# Crafting Interpreters
This is a repository for my work on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## First Interpreter
The first interpreter is written in F# and is currently the only thing within this repository.
Once I begin on the second interpreter, the first will be moved to a subdirectory and the second will be colocated next to it.
